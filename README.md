# RideSharingSelfSpringBoot

Machine coding Round:
Time given to code: 1hr 15 min.

Design Carpooling service like blabla car or quick-ride having following basic requirements:

Register a new user , each user having attributes like name, age, aadhar number etc.
Register a new vehicle
2a. Each vehicle should have info about owner(user), vehicle number, license number, vehicle type(two seater, three seater etc.), vehicle model etc.
2b. Only registered user should be able to register new vehicle and each user can register multiple vehicles.
Creating a ride, a registered user should be able to create ride having info about start city, end city, start date-time of journey, estimated time of journey.
Finding a ride, enter the start and end city and we should be able to fetch all rides available
Then have to demo the functionality of these basic operations.
Then discussion on how to have filters for ride, like someone wants to filter rides based on start time and other concatenated filters etc. , how we can do with minimal changes to current code and if we add new fields how'll the code modify. Basically modularity and extensibility of code was being tested.
